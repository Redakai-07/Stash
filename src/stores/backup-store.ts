/**
 * The backup flow, as a state machine.
 *
 * Deliberately one place rather than scattered across screens, because the
 * ordering *is* the safety property. A restore goes
 * file → parse → validate → decrypt → plan → confirm → apply, and no step may be
 * skipped or reordered: the database is only ever touched by the last one, and
 * only after the consequences of doing so have been computed and shown.
 *
 * The stages below are real states of the flow, which is why they live here and
 * not in component state — a dialog that lost its place because a re-render
 * moved it would be an awful thing to happen in the middle of a destructive
 * operation.
