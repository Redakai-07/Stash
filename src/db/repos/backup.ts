/**
 * Exporting, backing up and restoring, as database work.
 *
 * Everything in this module is the *impure* half of the backup feature: reading
 * tables, writing rows inside one transaction, and keeping the emergency copy.
 * The decisions — what a file means, what a restore would do — live in
 * `lib/backup`, where they are pure functions with no database in sight. Keeping
 * that line is what makes the safety properties testable.
 *
 * ## What is exported
 *
 * Every row of user data: folders and their hierarchy, saved links, tags, both
 * join tables, notes and subnotes, and the portable preferences. Favourites and
 * archive state are ordinary columns on those rows, so they travel too. The one
 * exclusion is the `security` table's device-bound material: a key that only
 * means something on the phone that wrote it has no business in a file.
 *
 * ## Atomicity
 *
 * A restore is one Dexie transaction over every table it touches. Dexie rolls a
 * transaction back as a unit, so a failure part-way through — a quota error, a
 * constraint problem, the app being killed mid-write — leaves the previous vault
 * exactly as it was. There is no "partially imported" state to clean up because
 * there is no commit until the last row is in.
 *
 * Nothing awaits WebCrypto inside the transaction. That is not a stylistic
 * choice: Dexie's zone tracking cannot follow an async boundary that is not
 * itself a Dexie operation, and awaiting a crypto promise inside a transaction
 * aborts it. Every secret is resolved before the transaction opens.

 * Build the backup file.

 *
 *  - `sealed` — locked rows travel as the ciphertext they already are, with the
 *    passcode-wrapped keyring beside them. The file reveals nothing about locked
 *    content, and a restore can still open it with the original passcode. This
 *    is the default because it is the only mode that is both safe to store and
 *    fully recoverable.
 *  - `encrypted` — the same payload, and then the whole thing is encrypted under
 *    a passphrase chosen for the file. Belt and braces: nothing is readable
 *    without that passphrase, and locked items still need the Stash passcode
 *    afterwards.
 *  - `plaintext` — every locked row is opened into the file. This is a complete,
 *    readable copy of the vault and it is offered because losing the only
 *    readable copy of your own data is worse than the exposure — but it is
 *    opt-in, it is labelled as what it is, and it refuses to run at all if it
 *    cannot open something, rather than quietly shipping ciphertext in a file
