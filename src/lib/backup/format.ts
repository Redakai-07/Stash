/**
 * The backup format.
 *
 * A backup is the user's data, in a shape that belongs to the user rather than
 * to the app. Three properties drive every decision in this module:
 *
 *  1. **Self-describing.** `format`, `version`, `appVersion`, `exportedAt` and
 *     `mode` are all readable from the file itself, so a person can tell what
 *     they are holding and an import can tell whether it must migrate, refuse or
 *     proceed — before anything touches the database.
 *  2. **Versioned and forward-compatible.** The version is a single integer and
 *     the reader is explicit about which versions it understands. A file from a
 *     newer build is refused with a clear message instead of being half-read.
 *  3. **Explicit about its own sensitivity.** `mode` says whether the file holds
 *     ciphertext, plaintext, or an encrypted payload. A backup that contains the
 *     user's locked content in the clear says so in the file, so nobody has to
 *     guess later how careful to be with it.
 */

/**
 * How locked content is represented in a file.
 *
 * - `sealed`   — locked items travel exactly as they are stored: AES-GCM
 *                ciphertext, plus the passcode-wrapped keyring so a restore can
 *                still open them. Requires the Stash passcode to read.
 * - `plaintext`— every item is opened first. The file is a complete, readable
 *                copy of the vault, locked items included. Requires nothing to
 *                read, which is exactly why it is opt-in and labelled.
 * - `encrypted`— the whole payload is encrypted under a *separate* backup
 *                passphrase, so a file can be handed over or stored without
 *                exposing locked items and without depending on a device
 *                keyring. Requires that passphrase to read.
