/**
 * Authenticated encryption, using only the platform's crypto.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is a cipher. Every primitive is `crypto.subtle`:
 * AES-256-GCM for confidentiality *and* integrity, PBKDF2-SHA256 for turning a
 * human passcode into a key. Stash picks parameters and composes established
 * primitives; it does not invent an algorithm, and it does not implement
 * anything itself.
 *
 * Two different AES-GCM keys are in play and it matters which is which:
 *
 *  - the *vault key* — a random 256-bit key that actually encrypts notes, link
 *    fields and folder names. It is never derived from anything a human types,
 *    so its strength does not depend on passcode quality;
 *  - a *wrapping key* — derived from the passcode via PBKDF2, used only to seal
 *    and unseal the vault key. This is the standard envelope (key-wrapping)
 *    shape, and it is why changing the passcode re-wraps 32 bytes instead of
 *    re-encrypting the whole vault.
 *
 * GCM's authentication tag is what makes this "authenticated": a modified
 * ciphertext, a swapped IV or a truncated payload fails to decrypt with an
 * exception rather than yielding plausible-looking garbage. Callers therefore
 * treat a decryption failure as "this data is not ours", never as "empty".
